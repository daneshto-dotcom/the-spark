# S194 PROGRESS — T11 rules (branch `s194/rules`) — R194-16 porch, R194-17 pants window

## ⏸ PAUSED (owner session limit) — EXACT NEXT STEP
- **State:** discovery only. `git merge master` done (fast-forward to ad812166, no conflicts). `npm install` done (exit 0). NO source edits yet. No gates run yet. No background processes left running.
- **Next step:** measure castle art opaque bounds (`public/art/castles/*-atlas.png`, 256 cells drawn at `CASTLE_SPRITE_PX` 96, foot at anchor.y + `KEEP_H`/2 = 29) to pick the new `CASTLE_PORCH_OFFSET_Y` (constants.ts:791); then add a porch-clearance arm to `zones.castleKeepOutHitsBox` (zones.ts:293 — the ONE predicate read by canBuildAt / stampRefusalAt / ghost / bots).
- **Findings so far:**
  - Only `castleBank.porchSlot` reads `CASTLE_PORCH_OFFSET_Y`; consumers of porchSlot: `firstFreePorchSlot`, `isOwnPorchSpark`, gathererLifecycle:208-212 (pull landing), botBrain:961-968 (porch-clear), pullFeedback.
  - `structureRepair` deliberately does NOT read the keep-out (FIX/SCRAP) — adding the porch arm to `castleKeepOutHitsBox` keeps that true.
  - R194-17 not started (next: grep `MONSTER_EMERGE_TICKS`, `MONSTER_HOLD_LEAD_TICKS`).
