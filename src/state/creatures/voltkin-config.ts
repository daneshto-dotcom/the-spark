/**
 * SPARK — Per-creature-type config table (S34 P2-20).
 *
 * **Audit lineage:** Gemini Council Q2 carry-forward across S26+S27+S28
 * (deferred while only Voltkin existed); S30 audit P2-20; S34 P2 batch shipped.
 *
 * **Purpose:** consolidate the 7 hardcoded per-creature constants that
 * previously lived as top-level exports in `creature.ts` into a single
 * canonical config record. Prerequisite for Anvil (S35+) — adding a second
 * creature type becomes `+1 CreatureConfig` entry + `+1 attack handler
 * dispatch` instead of `+N file edits per constant`.
 *
 * **Back-compat:** `creature.ts` continues to export the original constant
 * names (`VOLTKIN_LIFETIME_TICKS`, `VOLTKIN_ATTACK_RANGE_SQ`, etc.), with
 * the literal values now derived from `VOLTKIN_CONFIG` here. No call-site
 * needed updating — 8 importing files (5 prod + 3 test) compile unchanged.
 *
 * **PRIME-AUDIT Δ2 (S34 Council R1):** `attackRangeSq` is **NOT** a config
 * field. The pre-squared value is a sqrt-avoidance derivative; exposing it
 * in CreatureConfig would invite drift between the two. Consumers compute
 * `attackRange * attackRange` inline (or via the existing
 * `VOLTKIN_ATTACK_RANGE_SQ` back-compat re-export in creature.ts).
 *
 * **What's NOT in CreatureConfig (deliberate):**
 *   - Visual effect constants (`ARC_HALO_WIDTH`, `ARC_JITTER_AMP_PX`,
 *     `ARC_FLASH_DURATION_TICKS`) — describe the EFFECT, not the creature.
 *     Anvil might also use ARC_FLASH (cleave-style sparks). Stays in
 *     `src/render/effects/arcFlash.ts` + `lifetime.ts`.
 *   - Screen-shake constants — describe the shake effect, not the creature.
 *     Stays in `src/render/screenShake.ts`.
 *   - Cinematic-timing constants (`cinematicMs`, `FADE_MS`,
 *     `sustainedEffectMs`) — describe the cutscene overlay, not the creature
 *     spec. Stays in `src/render/cutsceneOverlay.ts`.
 *
 * **Empirical guard for byte-exact preservation:**
 * `src/state/save.replay.test.ts` (S33 P1-12 replay-determinism baseline)
 * runs two identically-seeded worlds through identical dispatch sequences
 * and asserts `JSON.stringify(snapshot(w1)) === JSON.stringify(snapshot(w2))`.
 * If this refactor changed any computed value, that test fails. Must stay
 * green post-refactor.

 * spawner-structure. Generalizes the Voltkin substrate (same FSM / Verlet /
 * SEVER_BOND choke point) with three behavioral diffs encoded here:
 *
 *   - `persistent: false` (S104 P1 — was true) — a FINITE `lifetimeTicks` so the swarm
 *     CHURNS: a chewer ages out through the SAME `!config.persistent` DESPAWNING→auto-delete
 *     FSM the Voltkin uses, freeing the spawner's per-spawner slot so its 15s cadence keeps
 *     producing (the owner's "constantly produce more every ~15s" fix). A chewer can also die
 *     early to a raid / potato / laser / slap (hp 1), or instantly when its spawner is destroyed.
 *   - `chewHits: 5` (= constants.ts `CHEW_HITS`) — instead of Voltkin's single
 *     mid-cycle zap, a chewer commits to ONE bond and lands 5 incremental chews
 *     (one per `CHEW_INTERVAL_TICKS` = 60), severing only on the final hit (R9).
 *     `attackCadenceTicks` therefore spans the whole chew (5 × 60 = 300) and
 *     `attackFireTick` is the final hit (300) so the FSM stays in ATTACKING for
 *     the full chew rather than bouncing to SEEKING after each hit.
 *   - `hopSpeedMul: 0.6` / `maxAccel: 120` — ~60% of Voltkin's top speed:
 *     a readable, counterable hop. `maxAccel = 200 × 0.6` (the de-hardcoded
 *     CREATURE_MAX_ACCEL scaled by hopSpeedMul).
 *
 * `lifetimeTicks` (3000 = 50s @ 60Hz) is the REAL despawn gate now (`persistent:false`):
 * the FSM auto-deletes at `despawnAtTick` and routes the last second through DESPAWNING, so
 * a timed-out chewer FADES (the renderer reserves the green-goo splat for KILLS). `attackRange`
 * is a touch shorter than Voltkin's 180 (chewers engage at melee-ish chew range, not a ranged arc).
 *
 * NOTE for downstream layers: the FSM chew loop, the split caps, the enemy-only
 * targeting, the spawner poll, and threading `hopSpeedMul`/`maxAccel` through
 * `computeSteeringAccel` all live in later layers. This entry only declares the
 * config; adding it here forces the CREATURE_CONFIGS exhaustiveness below.
