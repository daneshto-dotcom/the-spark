/**
 * SPARK — S180: **THE CANON IS PINNED TO THE CODE.**
 *
 * `SPARK_CANON.md` is the page a session reads to answer "is X still in the game?" and "how much
 * does Y hit for?". This file is what stops it becoming a liar.
 *
 * ⛔ WHY IT EXISTS. `UNIT_STAT_TABLE.md` is the repo's other generated stat page and it is **stale by
 * roughly 3× on the bosses** — it lists Vlad at 90 pool while `T9_BOSS_STATS` is hp 20 / def 8 = 260.
 * Nothing went red when the retune landed, so the document simply went on being wrong, and a
 * character sheet built from it would have printed a wrong number for every boss in the game. A
 * prose doc with no assertions behind it rots silently. This one cannot.
 *
 * ⛔ AND THE OWNER'S COMPLAINT IS THE SPEC HERE, not a style note. S180, after being asked a third
 * time about mechanics that were archived long ago:
 *
 * > *"let's resolve all of this once and for all so I don't have to go over all those things …
 * > this should be in our canonical document somewhere that you go to to see how things are."*
 *
 * The seagull miss is the shape of the failure: `constants.ts` already said, in as many words, that
 * four whole subsystems are unreachable in production. The information was never missing. It was not
 * read. So the canon states it in one place AND a test holds it there.
 *
 * ⚠ HOW TO ADD TO IT: a number goes in the canon only with the constant it came from, and its
 * assertion lands here in the SAME commit.
